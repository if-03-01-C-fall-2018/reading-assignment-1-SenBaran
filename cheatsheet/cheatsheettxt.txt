<h3>1.What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</h3>
<p>• a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource identifier (URI).<br>
• the publishing language HyperText Markup Language (HTML);<br>
• the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
<h3>2.How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</h3>
<p>With Hypertext and HTTP, URL is one of the key concepts of the Web. It is the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web.<br>
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. <br>
Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. In practice, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved. <br>
As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.</p>
<h3>3.What are the general components of a url?</h3>
<p>A URL for HTTP (or HTTPS) is normally made up of three or four components:<br>
<br>
• A scheme. The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. It can be HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL).<br>
• A host. The host name identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.example.com. A server provides services in the name of the host, but hosts and servers do not have a one-to-one mapping. Refer to Host names.<br>
&ensp;Host names can also be followed by a port number. Refer to Port numbers. Well-known port numbers for a service are normally omitted from the URL. Most servers use the well-known port numbers for HTTP and HTTPS , <br>
&ensp;so most HTTP URLs omit the port number.
• A path. The path identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. For example, /software/htp/cics/index.html.<br>
• A query string. If a query string is used, it follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can use for some purpose (for example, as parameters for a search or as data to be processed)<br>
&ensp;The query string is usually a string of name and value pairs; for example, term=bluebird. Name and value pairs are separated from each other by an ampersand (&); for example, term=bluebird&source=browser-search.</p>

<h3>1.What is a web server?</h3>
<p>A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, <br> in response to their requests, 
which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.Dedicated computers and appliances
 may be referred to as Web servers as well.
</p>
<h3>2.What does a web server?</h3>
<p>Web servers often come as part of a larger package of Internet- and intranet-related programs for serving email, downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files, and building and publishing Web pages.<br>
Considerations in choosing a Web server include how well it works with the operating system and other servers, <br>
its ability to handle server-side programming, security characteristics, and  the particular publishing, search engine and site building tools that come with it.</p>
<h3>3.How can content be stored on a web server?</h3>
<p>
In laymen terms, in very much like the way you store text, pictures, videos and mp3 files in your PC. Web pages are formed by a set of different files, which are stored on “servers”. <br>
These servers are also not much different from your ordinary PC, except that they are connected in a special way to the web 24hs a day, 7days a week.</p>
<h3>4.How is content in webpages described?</h3>
<p>Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. <br>It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.
In Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville write, "We define content broadly as 'the stuff in your Web site."<br>
This may include documents, data, applications, e-services, images, audio and video files, personal Web pages, archived e-mail messages, and more.<br> And we include future stuff as well as present stuff.</p>

<h3>1.What is a web client?</h3>
<p>The Web client is a client-side component within the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE), <br>
a distributed multi-tiered application model used for building and developing enterprise applications. Client-side components are typically computer applications running on a user's computer and connect to a server.
 These components perform client-side operations as they might need access to information available only on the client side, like user input, or because the server lacks the processing power necessary in such operations.<br>
J2EE is comprised of a client-tier, Web-tier, business-tier, and enterprise information system (EIS)-tier. Components that run on the client side of a machine are client-tier components.</p>
<h3>2.What does a web client?</h3>
<p>A web client lets the user request something on the server, and shows the user the result of the request.</p>

<h3>3.Web Client and Web Browser is the same</h3>
<p>Web server software (e.g. Apache, IIS, NGINX, Lighttpd) usually is used to deliver content and most of times it runs on servers located in data centers. <br>
Web client is an application (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) running on a local device (desktop, notebook, cell phone)<br>
 used to interact mainly with Web servers even though you can use your Web client to access servers running protocols others than HTTP and HTTPS.</p>

 <h3>1.What is the html head element?</h3>
 <p>The "head" element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the "html" tag and the "body" tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document.<br>
 Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.</p>
 <h3>2.What does "!DOCTYPE html" mean?</h3>
 <p>s the doctype for the document. It basically tells the web browser how to render the page (there are different doctypes).<br>
 If the page renders improperly with a correct doctype, that means that the page wasn't correctly coded.</p>
 <h3>3.What are the two top most elements within the html element?</h3>
 <p>•Top 1: Basic Texts "p" "/p"<br>
 •Top2: Lists
</p>
<h3>4.How to emphasize a text and how is it displayed in the browser?</h3>
<p>Type "em" <br>
Type the text that you want to emphasize.<br>
Type "/em".<br>
It will be shown a little bit smaller and a little bit italic
</p>
<h3>How to mark up important ext and how is it displayed in the browser?</h3>
<p>Type "strong" <br>
Type the text you want to make important. <br>
type "/strong"<br>
It will be shown a little bit thicker.
